      <h2>Problem Context</h2>
       <div>
       <a>‘Back to school asthma’ is a worldwide phenomenon describing the sharp increase in
         asthma related hospital visits observed by elementary and middle school absences
         each fall.</a></div>
         <div>
            <a>Children returning to school in the fall with mild to severe asthma are exposed to the
             coughs and colds from students in a busy new environment, escalated by a myriad of seasonal
             asthma triggers.</a>
           </div>
           <div>
             <a>The leading method to prevent asthma attacks from escalating is the
              ‘Asthma Action Plan’, a personalized set of instructions to be followed
              during an attack. </a>
            </div>
            <div>
              <a>
              The plan refers to the use of three everyday asthma products.
              The peakflow meter gauges the strength of your lungs, by
              the force of your breath. The inhaler expels medicine into a
              spacer, allowing it to be inhaled.</a>

         The Action Plan is helpful in controlling asthma attacks, however it
          often sits in a file folder deep in the school office or crushed
          beneath notebooks in a bag. When asthma flares up it may happen on the school bus,
          outside during gym class, or while away for lunch.</a>
          <div>
          <a>Information on the Action Plan is difficult
          to parse, especially under the anxiety
          and stress of an asthma attack. A child is then tasked with juggling between
          their inhaler and peak-flow meter, while attendants search for the action plan.</a>
        </div>
        <div>
      <a>Here we saw an opportunity to streamline the recovery process, determining 3 key insights: Cognitive Overload, Too many products, and a Necessity for Supervision.
        This prompted us to ask a series of questions that would later guide each of our decisions.

        <div>
        <a>AAPE is a fusion of three everyday asthma products, in one smart device.
          During research on the products, we observed how people [got around] using so many products.
          Some purchased carrying cases, some decided to take a risk and forgo the products entirely.
          There are guides online that show how to transform a plastic water bottle into a spacer - to
          create & dispose of on the go!</a>

          <a>When we saw this use case, we knew there was an opportunity for innovation. The idea we derived from this case is that
            all 3 asthma products are essentialy plastic cylinders - each with a simple mechanism. If we could combine the products into a single
            smart device that uses digital sensors to communicate data to an app - we could transform and accelerate the asthma attack recovery procedure.

            <a>
          Another contributor to the excess in asthma products are the many inhaler cannisters carrying various types of medicine that children with severe asthma may need to use daily.
          While we could not easily propose a change in the cannister form, we could make them easy to access and identify. AAPE is purchased with a set of QR stickers to be applied to each cannister,
          allowing a sensor to recognize which cannister is currently inside the aape.</a></div>

          <!-- (here we will need to show an image of the stickers provided with the aape that are then stuck on the cannisters.) -->

        <div>  <a>
          A cannister is released from the AAPE by squeezing it out from the rear of the product. The cannisters are easy to store, access, and swap as they sit in a
          fabric case with velcro pouches that also comes with purchase of the AAPE.</a>
