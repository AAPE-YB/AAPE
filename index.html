       <div>
       <a>Asthma is the most common long-term respiratory disease, affecting over half a million children in Canada.
       </a></div><div><a>
          An asthma attack describes a violent, often terrifying episode of coughing, wheezing, and tightness in the
           chest. According to Statistics Canada, these attacks claim more than 200 lives annually.
             ‘Back to school asthma’ is a worldwide phenomenon describing the sharp increase in asthma related
             hospital visits observed by elementary and middle school absences each fall.
          </a></div>

              September, known as ‘back to school’ (BTS) asthma, accounts for 20%–25% of all attacks requiring
              hospitalisation...”</h4>

              from students in a busy new environment, escalated by a myriad of seasonal asthma triggers.
              The leading method to prevent asthma attacks from escalating is the ‘Asthma Action Plan’ (AAP),
              a personalized set of instructions to be followed during an attack.

                The Inhaler expels medicine into the Spacer - a chamber that allows the medication to be
                properly and entirely inhaled.

         Information on the AAP is helpful in controlling asthma attacks, however it isn’t designed to be read
         by a child, and relies on an adult being there to help. When asthma flares up it may happen on a bus
         to school, outside during gym class, or while away for lunch. The child is then tasked with juggling
         between their Inhaler, Spacer, and Peak-Flow meter, while attendants search for their AAP. Vital
         information on the AAP is difficult to parse amidst the large amount of content, especially under
         the anxiety and stress of an asthma attack.</a>

        <a>During product research, we observed how people handled using and traveling with the Peak Flow meter,
          the Inhaler, and the Spacer. For younger children, parents purchased large carrying cases to travel
          with them in school bags. Our teenage audience often decided to take a risk and forgo the products entirely.
           The general consensus was that there are too many sizeable products to comfortably travel with.
            There are plenty of guides online that show how to transform a plastic water bottle into an inhaler
             spacer - to create on the go!

            When we saw this use case, we knew there was an opportunity for innovation.
            The idea we derived from this case is that all 3 asthma products are essentially
            plastic cylinders - each with a simple mechanism. By fusing the products into a single
            device that communicates data to our app, AAPE transforms and accelerates the asthma attack
            recovery procedure.</a>

          Another contributor to the excess in asthma products is the need to carry both preventative
          (colour coded as orange), and relieving (blue) medicine. This medicine is stored in canisters,
          that are provided in multiple inhalers. While we could not easily propose a change in the canister
          form, we could make them easy to access and identify. AAPE is purchased with a set of QR stickers

            reports. These reports can be generated and sent to his parents and family physician, to provide detailed
            records of Myles asthma history over time.</a>

        <a class="videocopy">Currently, Peak Flow meters categorize the results of lung strength measurements
          into three categories. The colour green denotes healthy and clear control. The colour yellow signals caution,
          as symptoms may improve or worsen. The colour red denotes an asthma attack. AAPE’s user interface reflects
          these colours, aside from red which was changed to a calming blue.</a>
            <a class="videocopy2">
              When Myles returns from an asthma attack he must take extra caution,
              as his lungs and asthma condition has not yet fully recovered from the trauma of an attack.
              The next time he opens the app, the experience will be different. As required after a serious episode,
              AAPE will increase the number of asthma management tasks, and the UI will turn yellow to remind Myles
              of his cautionary state. To provide comfort and hope to relieve uncertainty, AAPE will emphasize daily
              achievements and encouraging language.</a>

    <a class="thanks">AAPE is a project fueled by dollar donuts, sour cream & onion chips, hours spent in the Hyatt hotel lounge,
      and the support and encouragement from many friends and family. We would like to extend a gracious thank-you to;
      Marie Louka for invaluable research and direction during the inception of AAPE, Venus Lau & Michael Lo for sitting
      through our messy presentations to give us advice and critique, the Granholm family for their incredible acting talent,
      Shabal - who guarded and motivated us during the final hours with rousing pep talks, and lastly our friends and loved ones
      who we spent time apart from while tirelessly working to finish. Thanks so much!</a>
